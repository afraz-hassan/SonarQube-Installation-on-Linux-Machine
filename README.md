# SonarQube-Installation-on-Linux-Machine
This is a complete documentation for installing, configuring, and managing a self-hosted SonarQube instance on a Linux VM. A complete step-by-step tutorial about how to successfully install and setup SonarQube Community Edition (free and open-source) on the Linux machine. You can use any linux machine, whether it is Azure Virtual Machine, AWS EC2 Instance, or an on-premises server. All the steps are completely tested and verified as of **Dec 2025**. You can easily just follow the steps and configure your own self-hosted SonarQube. This tutorial is tested on Debian 11 and Ubuntu, but its supposed to run on any linux distribution. If you find anything wrong or suggest any improvement, feel completely free to reach me out on **afraz.hassan2006@gmail.com**.
